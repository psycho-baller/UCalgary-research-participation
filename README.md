# What it does
If you're UCalgary and taking PSYC 200,201,203? This could be helpful for you

When you run this code it will automatically check for u if there is a study up, and if there is, it will show you the study description and how many credits you will gain from taking it

Then, you wll be asked weather you want to take this study or not, if there are more than one study avalable, it will show you the decription if the other study once you decline the previous study

If you've accepted a study, you will be ask weather you want to start working on the study or not (if it's an online study)

Please connect with me if you have any good ideas to improve this project in any way

# Setup
Firstly, you will need to install python and have Google Chrome in your PC, I will add the ability to use Firefox instead of Chrome soon. You can install the latest version of python with the help of [this](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) tutorial or [this](https://youtu.be/Kn1HF3oD19c) tutorial. Make sure you've installed pip while installing python

Next, you'll have to install 2 packages: Selenium and Webdriver Manager

To install these packages, go to your command prompt (search 'cmd' and you'll find the application) and type:

`pip install selenium`

`pip install webdriver-manager`

You can either install there zip file [here](https://github.com/psycho-baller/UCalgary-research-participation/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or clone the repository or simply copy paste the [main.py](https://github.com/psycho-baller/UCalgary-research-participation/blob/master/main.py) code to your own .py file



Then, before running the [main.py](https://github.com/psycho-baller/UCalgary-research-participation/blob/master/main.py) file, insert your USER ID and password in line 26 and 27 respectively between the single quotation marks

# Future plans
The program takes around 15-20 seconds to run currently, There is a way where it can take just a few seconds but I was unable to make it work, maybe I will try again when I take PSYC 203

It is also far from being done, I'm still making changes to the code
